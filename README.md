# [Hack Club customs tracker](https://mrdarip.github.io/Hack-Club-customs-tracker/)

Made this project to facilitate knowing what fees each product has on each country

At first thought storing the data in Notion or an online spreadsheet as I didn't know how to hold a database on github pages but finally decided to have a JSON for each entity, surely it's not great for scalability, but I guess it won't hold more than 200 countries, 200 products and 200 customs for each country and product (8.000.000 rows)
